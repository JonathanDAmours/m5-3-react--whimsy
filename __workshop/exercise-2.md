# Exercise 2: Adding the date

There is no date in the tweet.

<!-- 1. In `TweetContext.js` declare a new variable called `date` and assign it a `Date` object: -->

```js
const date = new Date();
```

<!-- 2. Add the date to the provider. -->

<!-- 3. Retrieve it in `Tweet` -->

<!-- 4. Take a look at the styled components inside of `Tweet`, there is a component called `Timestamp` that is not being used. Use it to render the date below the tweet content (see the original screenshot, if you're not sure where it goes.) -->

Once you've done all that, you'll quickly realize that we broke the app!

```
Uncaught Error: Objects are not valid as a React child
```

This happened because `new Date()` creates a date _object_ and we need to pass the actual date along as a string.

Take a look at the [momentjs documentation](https://momentjs.com/). It's already been added as a project dependency. (You can confirm this by looking at the `package.json`).

<!-- 5. Follow the documentation on how to setup moment. -->
<!-- 6. You can replace `new Date()` with the proper `moment` syntax to get the date to render exactly like the screenshot below. -->
